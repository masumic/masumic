## About Me

I'm an undergraduate student at Rutgers University, double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. I’m passionate about building meaningful technology at the intersection of machine learning, data science, and healthcare.

Through the Break Through Tech AI Fellowship, I've completed a rigorous ML Foundations curriculum and collaborated on an AI Studio project addressing a real-world problem in partnership with an industry sponsor. I’ve also explored backend systems through Blueprint’s software development fellowship, where I worked on login authentication and database management using Python and SQL.

I value creativity, curiosity, and clarity in everything I build—and I’m always looking for new challenges that combine technical rigor with social impact.

## Featured Project: melanoma-identification

A temperature and image-based machine learning system for early melanoma detection.

- **Overview**: Built a diagnostic support tool that combines thermal and image data to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions.
- **Goals**: Create an accessible, low-cost prototype for early skin cancer detection.
- **Tools Used**: Python, OpenCV, scikit-learn, K-Nearest Neighbors, Flask
- **Results**: Achieved high classification accuracy using KNN on processed visual data and integrated temperature thresholds.
- **Visuals**: Includes image samples, temperature charts, and decision boundaries
- **Next Steps**: Expand dataset, integrate real-time feedback UI, and test with new image samples.
- **My Role**: Led model training, feature extraction, and designed the integrated interface using Flask.

## Additional Projects

**svm-sentiment-analysis-feedback**  
SVM model to classify sentiment in customer service feedback data.  
- Tech Used: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas  
- Goal: Help businesses identify pain points via automated sentiment classification.  

**credit-card-fraud-prediction-model**  
A machine learning pipeline to identify fraudulent transactions using a labeled dataset.  
- Tech Used: R, caret, ranger, randomForest, e1071, tidymodels  
- Goal: Compare performance of two classifiers (Random Forest and Naive Bayes) on detecting fraud.  
- Result: Random Forest achieved higher accuracy and precision. Key predictors included transaction amount, category, and time.
